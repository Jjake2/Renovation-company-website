Yes, here is everything before May 10th:

	1.	A few days before May 9th:
	•	Viewed the property at 3222 Sedgwick Drive, noticed significant repairs needed. Rental price reduced from $3,800 to $3,200, reflecting the home’s condition.
	•	Asked Chad, the representative, if you could paint the place. Chad asked the homeowner, who agreed to exchange the work for the first month’s rent.
	2.	May 9th:
	•	Came to sign the lease; the addendum for repairs and work was already included.
	•	Signed the lease and the addendum. Chad took the paperwork to the landlord for her signature and sent email copies.
	3.	May 10th:
	•	Moved into the property. Started work on the main bathroom because it was the primary bathroom for the house and also began work on one of the smaller bedrooms.
	•	While working, realized how poor the condition of the walls were.
	•	Noticed that the carpets in the three bedrooms, living room, and stairs leading to the basement could use upgrading to match the rest of the flooring in the house.
	•	Called Chad to ask if the landlord would agree to replace the carpets. Received confirmation via text message that the landlord agreed.
	•	Flooring job involved 1,000+ square feet, including stairs. Estimated cost around $10,000, considering removal, prep, materials, and installation.
